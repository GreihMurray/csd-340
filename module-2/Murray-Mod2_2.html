		<p class="intro">My name is Greih Murray. I currently work as a software engineer for Charter Communications. <span class="sentence">I have worked for Charter for nearly 1 year full time.</span></p>
		<p>I am originally from Jefferson City, MO. I moved to St. Louis, MO when I started my bachelor's degree at Fontbonne University. I now live and work near St. Louis.</p>
		<p>I have two brothers, one older and one younger. My older brother works in Chicago and is an architect. My younger brother still lives in Jefferson City.</p>
		<p>I have a few hobbies which are fairly varied. I enjoy reading, playing board games, playing video games, and working out. I also previously played several sports competitively, though I do not anymore. Now I primarily enjoy going to the gym and playing sports for fun.</p>
